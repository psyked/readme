#### Introduction

_Hi, I'm James._

Writing a self-README feels like a good way to share my own thoughts about working with myself, in a format that's curated by me and always available - unlike an email, Slack message or passing conversations which can get lost or misrepresented over time.

#### Getting started

I prefer James instead of nicknames. My online handle is predominantly @psyked (siiked - the 'p' is silent) which I came up with back in university. But don't call me that or everyone will be confused, including me.

#### Personality

By some definitions I'm an Introvert, and by others an Extrovert. In noisy or social environments I tend to be quiet and reserved, but I'm motivated by the feedback of others rather than myself.

#### Social Media

I'm on Twitter and Instagram, if you're interested. I use Twitter to harvest industry-related news, and generally avoid making a splash. I use Instagram to record the visual things that I like, but generally nothing too personally identifiable.

I read for pleasure and I enjoy writing. I appreciate good, engaging writing. I publish things as often as I can on places like Medium and my blog.
