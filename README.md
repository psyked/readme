## Introductions

> _Hi, I'm James._

I prefer James instead of nicknames. My online handle is predominantly @psyked (siiked - the 'p' is silent) which I came up with back in university. But don't call me that or everyone will be confused, including me.

### Why this website/document exists

Writing a self-README feels like a good way to share my own thoughts about working with myself, in a format that's curated by me and always available - unlike an email, Slack message or passing conversations which can get lost or misrepresented over time. [Plus, all of the cool kids are doing it.](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe)

## About Me

### My Personality

By some definitions I'm an Introvert, and by others an Extrovert. What that means in practice is that in chaotic or social environments I tend to be more quiet and reserved, but I'm motivated by the feedback of other people rather than myself.

### Me on Social Media

I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/psyked) and [Instagram,](https://www.instagram.com/psyked/) if you're interested. I use Twitter to harvest industry-related news, and generally avoid making a splash. I use Instagram to record the visual things that I like, but generally nothing too personally identifiable.

### My Hobbies & Interests

I read for pleasure and I enjoy writing. I prefer Science Fiction or Fantasy Novels and the occasional Thriller. I appreciate good, engaging writing. I publish things as often as I can on places like [Medium](https://medium.com/@psyked) and [my blog.](https://psyked.co.uk)
